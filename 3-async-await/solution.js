/*
INSTRUCTIONS

1. using async/await API consume products and prices methods
2. both methods expect an integer positive id
3. use Promise.all and Promise.allSettled to consume both methods in parallel
4. to generate the id do the following invoke Date.now(), and take the last two digits, this will be your id, cast it accordingly
5. present correct results with console.log(), the format is up to you, but it must include id, product and price

Example:
{
 id:100,
 product:'paper',
 price:1
}

6. both methods include some conditions to fail, manage errors accordingly, at the end you should console.log() the errors,
the format is up to you
7. add any necessary adjustments to solution()

8. as an extra challenge add Promise.race() and Promise.any(), and try to get the idea of what happens

function solution() {
    // YOUR SOLUTION GOES HERE

    // You generate your id value here

    // You use Promise.all here

    // You use Promise.allSettled here

    // Log the results or errors here
}
